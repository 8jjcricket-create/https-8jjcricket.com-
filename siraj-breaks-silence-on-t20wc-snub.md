**Mohammed Siraj**, one of India’s prominent fast bowlers, opened up about his exclusion from the **15-member squad** for the **T20 World Cup 2026**, co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka.  

The tournament, scheduled from **February 7 to March 8**, will see **Suryakumar Yadav** lead a strong Indian side featuring **Jasprit Bumrah, Arshdeep Singh, Harshit Rana**, and other pace options, along with versatile all-rounders and spinners.  

Siraj, who has picked **14 wickets in 16 T20Is**, expressed disappointment but remained supportive of the team:  

> "I played in the last T20 World Cup, but not this time. For a player, playing in a World Cup is a dream; playing for your country is even better. The team is quite good on paper and in form. My best wishes to them. Keep the trophy here," he said.  

His remarks highlight both his professionalism and optimism as India prepares for a competitive tournament.
